Hello all. 	(´⊕ ‸ ⊕`.❁) 

My name is Sophia, but you can also call me ``elmo castle``. I am a high school student. 


I enjoy computer algebra, category theory and numerical analysis. My favorite language is Fortran, but I've also taken a liking to D.


I also have some degree of experience in machine learning, especially reinforcement theory. 
I've put off using GitHub for years, so this page is currently a blank slate.
